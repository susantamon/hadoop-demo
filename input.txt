The World Bank (WB) has asked Pakistan to stop pursuing the
Kishanganga dam dispute in the International Court of Arbitration (ICA)
and instead accept India’s offer of appointing a “neutral expert”.
The Pakistani daily Dawn reported on Tuesday that the World Bank president
Jim Yong Kim had last week advised the government to not take the matter to the ICA.
Incidentally, the bank had on November 10, 2016 even picked a US chief justice, the rector
of Imperial College, London, and the WB president to appoint a chairman of the court to
resolve the dispute over the dam.
Pakistan had opposed the construction of Kishanganga dam + , considering it a violation of a
World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of waters from the Indus and its tributaries.
 New Delhi believes that the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) allows it to build ‘run-of-river’ hydel projects
 that do not change the course of the river and do not deplete the water level downstream.
